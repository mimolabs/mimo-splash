# Cucumber Splash Pages

Hello, this is the current repository for the Cucumber Tony splash pages. Feel free to fork and make changes.

This the source code for the production logins we use for our hosted splash pages. If you want to test them out, sign-up for a Cucumber dashboard over here:

## How to Use

It's generally best that you use our hosted ones since, we'll look after them for you. However, if there's something you wanted to add, or some styling you really need to change (and can't do in our editor), feel free to host yourselves.

In theory, you should be able to shove on a service like Heroku and be up and running in two. In reality you'll need some more time.

The logins require NodeJS and use AngularJS as the framework.

They work with all the major manufacturers, and are compatible with tonnes of different access types:

- Clickthrough
- Password
- Social
- Registration
- Vouchers
- Paid

All the changes, styles, options, access types are controlled from your Cucumber dashboard.
